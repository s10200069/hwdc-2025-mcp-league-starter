# Development Backend URL (for Next.js rewrites)
# Used only in development mode to proxy /api/* requests to backend server
# In production, Nginx handles routing, so this is ignored
#
# Default: http://localhost:8000 (matches backend dev server port)
# Adjust if your backend runs on a different port
DEV_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
